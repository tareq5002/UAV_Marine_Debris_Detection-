# UAV_Marine_Debris_Detection-
Vision-based UAV system for marine debris detection using YOLO and deep learning.

Introduction:
Marine plastic pollution is now a serious global problem, posing a threat to marine ecosystems, marine biodiversity, and human health. Marine garbage needs to be monitored effectively, especially in coastal and near-coastal regions, to inform policy mitigation. Nevertheless, traditional surveillance systems of manual beach survey and ship-based inspection can be tedious, expensive, and not extensive in terms of their spatial capacity or coverage. 
In this research project, the authors study the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in conjunction with computer vision and deep learning methods in order to create an automated and scalable marine debris detection system.

Research Objectives:
The main research aims of this research are:
To develop a vision-based UAV surveillance system used in marine debris detection.
To use the deep learning object detection models to detect plastic trash in aerial images.
To test lightweight and real-time models that can be used in UAV deployment.
To determine the detection performance on traditional evaluation measures.

Methodology:
The study will include the gathering and examination of aerial images and video footage that will be taken by civilian UAV systems that have high-resolution cameras. The training and validation will be based on publicly available and annotated datasets.

Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning models, especially the YOLO family of object detection models, will be investigated as they have a trade-off between the accuracy of detections and real-time performance. Preprocessing and augmentation of data will be used to enhance the robustness of the models.

Experiments and Evaluation
The standard metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP), will be used to measure model performance. Efficiency and accuracy will be analyzed by running comparative experiments of the baseline and optimized models.

Applications:
Ocean and marine environmental surveillance.
Marine debris and plastic trash evaluation.
Research and policy support environmental research.

Disclaimer:
The project is a purely academic and environmental research project. It is not military, defence, or security-related applications.
